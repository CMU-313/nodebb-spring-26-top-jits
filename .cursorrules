- Follow the principle that I should fully understand everything new change in the codebase
- Never generate more than one small, logical unit of work per response
- Always explain design decisions
- When you make an architectural choice, briefly note what alternatives exist and why you chose this one
- Do not modify files that aren't immediately required by the current logical unit of work
- Prefer explicit over clever — no magic, no unnecessary abstraction
- If a task requires touching more than 1 files, stop and ask me to break it down further
