# Private Posts User Guide

## Overview

Private posts allow any user to create posts that only moderators and administrators can see. This feature helps facilitate internal discussions, sensitive communications, and moderation-specific content without exposing it to regular users.

## Who Can Create Private Posts

Anybody can create a private post, though only moderators or admins will be able to see them.

## Creating a Private Post

### When Creating a New Topic

1. Start composing your topic by clicking "New Topic"
2. In the composer toolbar (located near the top of the composer, next to the "Question" toggle), you will see a "Private" button with a lock icon
3. Click the "Private" button to enable private mode (the lock icon will fill in)
4. Write your post content as normal
5. Click "Post" or "Submit" to publish your private topic

### When Replying to a Topic

1. If the main post of the topic is private, the "Private" option will be automatically enabled for your reply
2. If the main post is not private, you can choose to make your reply private by clicking the "Private" button in the toolbar
3. Write your reply content
4. Click "Post" to submit

### When Editing a Post

1. Click the edit icon on the post you wish to modify
2. In the composer, click the "Private" button to toggle the post between private and public
3. Make your changes to the content
4. Click "Post" to save the updated post with the new privacy setting

Note: You can only edit posts you have created.

## Understanding the Private Indicator

When you view a private post, you will see:
- A lock icon
- A yellow badge with the word "Private"
- A tooltip message: "This post is private and only visible to moderators"

## Viewing Private Posts

As a moderator or administrator:
- Private posts appear normally in topics you have access to
- You can read, reply to, and edit private posts just like any other post
- The privacy badge helps you identify which posts are private at a glance

As a regular user:
- Private posts are hidden from your view
- If a topic contains only private posts, you will see a message: "This topic contains only private posts. If this is unexpected behavior, please contact system administrator"
- You will not be able to see any private content within that topic
