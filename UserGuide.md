# Private Posts User Guide

## Overview

Private posts allow any user to create posts that only moderators and administrators can see. This feature helps facilitate internal discussions, sensitive communications, and moderation-specific content without exposing it to regular users.

## Who Can Create Private Posts

Anybody can create a private post, though only moderators or admins will be able to see them.

## Creating a Private Post

### When Creating a New Topic

1. Start composing your topic by clicking "New Topic"
2. In the composer toolbar (located near the top of the composer, next to the "Question" toggle), you will see a "Private" button with a lock icon
3. Click the "Private" button to enable private mode (the lock icon will fill in)
4. Write your post content as normal
5. Click "Post" or "Submit" to publish your private topic

### When Replying to a Topic

1. If the main post of the topic is private, the "Private" option will be automatically enabled for your reply
2. If the main post is not private, you can choose to make your reply private by clicking the "Private" button in the toolbar
3. Write your reply content
4. Click "Post" to submit

### When Editing a Post

1. Click the edit icon on the post you wish to modify
2. In the composer, click the "Private" button to toggle the post between private and public
3. Make your changes to the content
4. Click "Post" to save the updated post with the new privacy setting

Note: You can only edit posts you have created.

## Understanding the Private Indicator

When you view a private post, you will see:
- A lock icon
- A yellow badge with the word "Private"
- A tooltip message: "This post is private and only visible to moderators"

## Viewing Private Posts

As a moderator or administrator:
- Private posts appear normally in topics you have access to
- You can read, reply to, and edit private posts just like any other post
- The privacy badge helps you identify which posts are private at a glance

As a regular user:
- Private posts are hidden from your view
- If a topic contains only private posts, you will see a message: "This topic contains only private posts. If this is unexpected behavior, please contact system administrator"
- You will not be able to see any private content within that topic

# Anonymous Posts User Guide

## Overview

Anonymous posts allow logged in users to create posts where their identity is hidden from other regular users. When marked as anonymous, other users will see just a "Anonymous" label and a generic icon instead of the author's real name and avatar. Only the post author as well as moderators and administrators can still see the real poster

## Permissions

Any logged-in user can create an anonymous post. There are no special permissions required. The following are the possible user states:
- **The post author**: can always see their own identity on anonymous posts
- **Moderators and administrators**: can always see the real author of anonymous posts
- **Other regular users**: see "Anonymous" and generic icon in place of the author's name / avatar

## Creation

### When creating a post/response/etc
1. At the bottom of the composer, you will see a checkbox labeled "Post anonymously"
2. Check the "Post anonymously" checkbox to enable anonymous mode
3. Write your topic title and content as normal
5. Click "Post" / "Submit" to publish it anonymously

## What is shown
When viewing an anonymous post as a regular user (who is not the author), you will see:
- A circular gray icon with a agent silhouette in place of the author's avatar
- The name `Anonymous` displayed in place of the author's username
- Author's profile link, group badges, and custom profile info are all hidden/disabled/regular text

When viewing an anonymous post as the author or as a moderator/administrator, you will see:
- The real author's avatar and username displayed as normal
- The post otherwise functions like any other post

## For topic listings / other pages showing personal info
Anonymous posts are also reflected in topic list previews:
- For **topic listings** (e.g., on a category page), if the topic's main post is anonymous, the author's avatar is replaced with the anonymous secret-agent icon
- In **topic teasers** (the last reply preview shown beside a topic), if the latest reply is anonymous, the teaser shows the anonymous icon instead of the replier's avatar
- For the **category "last post" previews**, anonymous posts display the anonymous icon in place of the poster's avatar
